## Project Overview
A modern, glassmorphism-style Teacher Management Interface built with React. The application provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing teachers, students, classes, attendance, reports, and schedules, all within a visually appealing, dark-themed, and responsive UI. The system operates entirely on the client-side using LocalStorage for data persistence, making it fully functional without requiring a backend server.
