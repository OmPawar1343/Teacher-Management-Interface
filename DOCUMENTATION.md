- **Framer-motion** for smooth, engaging animations
- **LocalStorage** for live, persistent data without backend
- **Responsive layouts** for all devices
- **Reusable components** for maintainability

## 📝 Assumptions
- No backend: all data is stored in LocalStorage
- User is an admin/teacher managing the system
- All features are accessible from the sidebar
- UI/UX is prioritized for clarity and ease of use
