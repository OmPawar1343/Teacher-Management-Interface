## üé® Design Decisions & Rationale

- **Glassmorphism & Dark Mode:**  
  For a modern, visually appealing, and eye-friendly interface.

- **LocalStorage:**  
  All data is stored in the browser for simplicity, privacy, and offline use.

- **Component-based Architecture:**  
  Promotes code reuse and maintainability.

- **Framer Motion:**  
  Used for smooth, modern animations (e.g., splash screen).

- **Mobile-first Design:**  
  Ensures usability on all devices.

- **CSV Support:**  
  Makes bulk data management easy for users.

---

## üìù Assumptions

- **No Backend:**  
  All data is stored in LocalStorage; no server or database is required.

- **Single User:**  
  The app is designed for use by a single teacher/admin at a time.

- **Offline Capable:**  
  The app works without an internet connection after initial load.

- **Modern Browser:**  
  Requires a browser with ES6+ support.

- **Initial Data:**  
  All students and classes are set to 10A by default for demo/testing.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- **Attendance:**  
  By default, all students are in class 10 A. Attendance works for these classes. To use other classes, add them via the Classes section.
